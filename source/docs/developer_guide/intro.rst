Introduction to Development
***************************

Due to the nature of QGIS's freely available, open and GPL-licensed source code,
*anyone* can develop new features or improve existing ones, whenever such a need
arises.

This guide covers taking the first steps from user or existing developer to
becoming a QGIS developer. It includes an overview of the technologies used and
recommends tools and workflows for crafting and managing QGIS-related C++ and
Python source code.  

The guide will focus on the many avenues one can gain working knowledge and apply
their ideas to help the project, themselves or their business, whether it be
with writing plugins, standalone apps, documentation or tutorials, to submitting
code pull requests or becoming a core project developer.  

Benefits
========

Personal investment in QGIS development skills will return dividends for years,
in meeting one's project goals and creating efficient GIS workflows. Submitting
code advancements back to the QGIS project offers the satisfaction that one's
work will benefit users *throughout the world*, in many varied GIS domains, at
the same time giving others the opportunity to improve upon the submitted work.

Unlike commercial software, businesses sponsoring QGIS development can be
assured their financial investment goes directly towards needed features or
fixes, rather than their software manufacturer's marketing budget, recurring
license fees or unwanted additional features.
